## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
**WD Seatwork 2** is a multi-page static website project created for a web design activity. It demonstrates fundamental HTML and CSS skills through a visually styled title page and linked subpages. The title page features a clean layout with navigation buttons, a stylized logo, and responsive design elements. Each button redirects users to content-specific pages that showcase structured sections, imagery, and hover interactions. This project highlights practical application of front-end design principles and serves as a simple portfolio-style demo site.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   |   └─ style.css
